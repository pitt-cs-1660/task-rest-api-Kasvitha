# **Vagrant with Docker**
#### **YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TO EDIT THE [VagrantFile](Vagrantfile)**

This guide will walk you through setting up your local development environment using **Vagrant** with **Docker** as the provider.

We are using **Vagrant** to standardize our local development environment. Instead of installing dependencies directly on your machine, Vagrant will spin up a **Docker container** for your development work. This ensures that everyone has a consistent environment regardless of their operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Since the class has a diverse array of operating systems, using Vagrant with Docker ensures that everyone has the same development environment. Traditionally Vagrant was used with popular virtualization software like VirtualBox, but now with the prevalence of arm64 and M1 Macs, Docker is a more lightweight and efficient choice.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following installed:

### 1. **Docker**
   - Download and install **Docker Desktop** for your platform:
     - [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
     - [Docker for macOS](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
     - Linux: Install via your package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, etc.).
   - Verify that Docker is installed:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```
     You should see the Docker version output.

   - Ensure that your project directory is **file-shared** (for Windows/macOS users):
     - Open **Docker Desktop > Settings > Resources > File Sharing**.
     - Add your project directory (e.g., `C:\Users\<username>\project` or `/Users/<username>/project`).

### 2. **Vagrant**
   - Download and install **Vagrant**:
     - [Vagrant for all platforms](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads).
   - Verify that Vagrant is installed:
     ```bash
     vagrant --version
     ```
     You should see the Vagrant version output.

### 3. **Vagrant Docker Plugin**
   - Vagrant supports Docker natively, but you can ensure compatibility with:
     ```bash
     vagrant plugin install vagrant-docker-compose
     ```

## **Vagrant Commands Explained**

Below are the most commonly used Vagrant commands during development:

### 1. **Start the Development Environment:**
   ```bash
   vagrant up --provider=docker
   ```
   - Spins up the Docker container.
   - This command checks for any changes in the `Vagrantfile` and applies them if necessary.

### 2. **SSH into the Container:**
   ```bash
   vagrant ssh
   ```
   - Opens an interactive shell session inside the Docker container.
   - Useful for running commands directly inside the container (e.g., `poetry install`, `uvicorn`).

### 3. **Stop the Development Environment:**
   ```bash
   vagrant halt
   ```
   - Stops the running Docker container without destroying it.
   - Run this when you’re done working for the day.

### 4. **Restart the Container and Reprovision:**
   ```bash
   vagrant reload --provision
   ```
   - Restarts the container and applies any changes made to the `Vagrantfile` or provisioning scripts.
   - Use this when you update environment configurations or dependencies.

### 5. **Destroy the Container:**
   ```bash
   vagrant destroy -f
   ```
   - Destroys the Docker container entirely.
   - Use this to reset the environment or reclaim disk space.

### 6. **Check Container Status:**
   ```bash
   vagrant status
   ```
   - Displays the current status of the Vagrant-managed container.

## **Accessing the API**

After running:
```bash
poetry run uvicorn cc_simple_server.server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
The API will be available outside the Vagrant machine at:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## **Common Issues and Solutions**

### **1. Docker File Sharing Issues (Windows/macOS)**
   - If you see errors related to file mounts or missing files, ensure the project directory is shared in Docker Desktop settings.

### **2. Permission Issues Inside the Container**
   - If you encounter `Permission denied` errors:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod -R u+rwx /home/vagrant/app
     ```

### **3. FastAPI Not Reloading**
   - If changes to your code don’t reflect:
     - Check if the Uvicorn process is running with the `--reload` flag.
     - Run:
       ```bash
       poetry run uvicorn cc_simple_server.server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
       ```

## **Why Are We Using Vagrant with Docker?**

- **Consistency:** All students have the same development environment, regardless of operating system.
- **No Local Dependency Conflicts:** Your local Python/Docker setup remains clean.
- **Ease of Use:** With just a few commands (`vagrant up`, `vagrant ssh`, etc.), you can quickly get started without worrying about complex configurations.

By using Vagrant with Docker, we abstract away environment setup complexities while giving you the flexibility to focus on development.
